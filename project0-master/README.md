For this project I used a few of my personal photos to a create a simple photography portfolio site.

I used five of my personal travel photos and created five different html pages under the folder 'image-pages'.  On each page there is photo, a
title, and a photo description in the form of a latin quote from a latin author.  In addition, each of the five pages contains an applied
header.html, gallery.html, footer.html.  I used the example from w3 schools (cited in code) to include these three files in for
every photo page (since these are always the same, it's better to add them like this rather than duplicating code).

Another page to look at is the about.html page.  The link for it is available in the footer and it includes a table of contents
and picture information.  This is also an important page because it demonstrates several of the requirements in an artistic way.

For styling I use the style.scss and then compile it to style.css.  These contain all the styling for my pages.
