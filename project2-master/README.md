# Project 2


For this Project names Chatterbox I created a messaging application.  It asynchronously gets and sends the message data among users.

I left the application.py in the root, my index.js and css files inside of the 'static' folder, and my html files inside of the
'templates' folder.

For my 'Personal Touch' milestone I added the functionality of being able to delete one's own messages

The look and feel of the UI is intentionally clean and simple to allow for better view of the messages.  I use colors from the
Monakai theme just like in Submlime Text. In addition, while the channel list might seem un organized, this is for artisitc effect
to provide an abstract arrangement of channels and to diverge from the common design excercises of having everything perfectly
in a list.
